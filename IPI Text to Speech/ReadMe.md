IPI Text to Speach

I my previous NHS role I found that I did not have time to read all the emails about news and staff related topics. So, I developed an Outlook VBA App to read the emails to me whilst I continued to work. This was very helpful, as it allowed me to be up to date with what was going on in the organisation and highlighted points of interest which I could then further investigate once I had a spare moment.

I later decided that it would be good to have the same function avaliable from the Desktop and I developed a powershell version.
