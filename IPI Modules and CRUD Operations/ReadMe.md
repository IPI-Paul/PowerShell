IPI Modules and CRUD Operations

Whilst still learning R Programming, I had a work related Proof of Concept yearning to satisfy. As usual, I put my work needs first. Unfortunately I am no longer in that role and who knows if my new role will have as great a demand for a PowerShell script that can carry out CRUD operations on the fly and is easily accessible from a shortcut file.

Although I have used PowerShell for several other percieved solutions in the past, I still had to face many challenges:
 - Having to learn how to create and use Classes to replace VBA Custom Types I have become accustomed to
 - Having to learn how to create and use Records and Data Grids to replace VBA ADODB Recordsets I have also become accustomed to
 - Having to learn how to create custom parameters dynamically and pass them with the cmdlets to invoke expressions
 - Having to learn how to utilise foreach loops and piped outputs to build hash tables
 - Having to learn how to send WPF WebBrowser calls to JavaScript functions and then on to JQuery
 - Having to learn how to send JQuery events back through the WPF WebBrowser to initiate PowerShell functions
 - Having to learn how to create PowerPoint hyperlinks when filling in Slide Text ranges
 - Having to learn how to create Word hyperlinks when filling in Table Cells
 - Having to learn how to use PowerShells DOM objects to pick out Table Header colors

Each one of these challenges took time and effort, but gladly, were all achievable and there were al lot more not mentioned here, even migrane headaches to boot!
